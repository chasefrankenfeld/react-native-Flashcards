# React Native - Mobile Flashcards (Udacity Course)

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React-Native course.

I have built a mobile application that allows users to create and study a collection of flashcards. Users will be able to create a deck with a title, and add cards with questions and answers to these decks. They will then be able to quiz themselve on a deck and receive a percentage result of the number of correct results.

*To run this project

2. Go into the folder
3. Install the requirements from the included package.json file: yarn install
4. Run the project with yarn start
5. This project is designed for iOS, although should work with Android.
